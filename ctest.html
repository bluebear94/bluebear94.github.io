<p>Last update: 21 June 2017</p>

<p>Being a compendium of conlanging lore, experiences, rites of passage,
and humour, all masquerading as a test.</p>

<p>This Test is, obviously, inspired by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120829225029/http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/susan/joke/hacker.htm">Hacker
test</a>. I welcome further suggestions for new questions and
alterations to existing ones, and would like to point out that the
test is not specifically designed to give myself the highest possible
score :-)</p>

<p>Score one point for each question to which you can answer "yes",
unless otherwise indicated. You are allowed some leeway in
interpreting the questions; it's not all that important anyway.</p>

<p>This version of the test was created by Geoff Eddy with help from
assorted members of the Zompist Bulletin Board, and modified by Uruwi
(bluebear94).</p>
