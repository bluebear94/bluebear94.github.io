  <h2> Languages of the Domains </h2>
  <h3> Domain I </h3>
  <ul>
    <li> [5] <b> Ḋraħýl Rase </b> – the language spoken in Ḋraħyn-Nŷr. One of the few languages that has a speaker-referent pronoun system. Fairly rich morphology, but nothing truly unusual. </li>
    <li> [6] <b> Varta Avina </b> (Kavinan) – analytic SVO/NA/Pr language with intial consonant mutations and base-14 numerals. Again, nothing truly unusual. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3> Domain II </h3>
  <ul>
    <li> [7] <b> Lek-Tsaro </b> – spoken in Rymako thousands of years ago. Food-hole sounds are accompanied by rod signals. Features anaphoric pronouns and a tree mode, but very little recursion. Numerals are fairly unusual and impractical. Names can be like the ones of our languages, but they can also be whole clauses, or in extreme cases, multiple clauses. Uses a script inspired by one of my childhood cyphers. This languages was influenced by Isoraķatheð's works <i>from the start.</i> </li>
    <li> [7_1] <b> Middle Rymakonian </b> – a descendant of Lek-Tsaro. Uses phonoruns. </li>
    <li> [8] <b> Jbl </b> – official language of Nŋln, and widely spoken elsewhere. Consonants and vowels are interchangeable, and instead of nouns and verbs, there are concretes and abstracts. Allows speakers to use whatever base they want, and there are nonconservative determiners as well. </li>
  </ul>
  <h2> Other languages </h2>
  <ul>
    <li> [1][2] These are both relexes that are not even worth talking about. </li>
    <li> [3] <b> Mođëp'öso </b> – has an unusual (in a bad sense) phonology but little else is interesting. </li>
    <li> [4] <b> Necarasso Cryssesa </b> – literally &quot;forest language&quot;. Intended to have an elvish aesthetic, but abandoned due to verbosity and naturalism issues. </li>
    <li> [8.5] A language with many features I dislike. Tense consonants à la Korean, a politeness system and almost everything from Spanish (grammatical number being a notable feature that's absent). </li>
  </ul>
