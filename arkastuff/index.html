  <h1> Uruwi's Arka portal </h1>
  <h2> Starter resources </h2>
  <p> <a href="http://conlinguistics.org/arka/e_index.html"> The official Arka website </a> is no longer maintained (it seems), but it's a good resource for people who want to learn about Arka. </p>
  <p> <a href="http://mindsc.ape.jp/klel/"> The Vulgar Arka dictionary </a> is still updated (albeit in Japanese); this is the dictionary you should be using. </p>
  <p> <a href="http://titlilgas.blogspot.jp/2016/08/blog-post_3.html"> Titlil Gas's portal. </a> </p>
  <p> <a href="https://www33.atwiki.jp/kakis/pages/1.html"> Kakis Erl Sax's wiki </a> is a great place for historical Arka materials if you can read Japanese. </p>
  <h2> What to watch out for </h2>
  <p> Things that aren't mentioned in the official site, at least not well. </p>
  <ul>
    <li> <hacm>o</hacm> is used before a word starting with a consonant. <hacm>ont</hacm> comes before a vowel-initial word. </li>
    <li> If you want to relativise an object of a preposition (here, we use &quot;preposition&quot; for what the official site calls &quot;casers&quot;), the preposition should be put at the end of the clause, as done in English while trying to piss prescriptivists off. <i>The city in which we live</i> is translated, for instance, as <hacm>haim l'ans ra ka</hacm> (city <sc>rel</sc>=<sc>1pl</sc> live in). Omitting the preposition is also acceptable. See <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/faraspalt/levian/arka/vez/le">this page</a> for more details. </li>
    <li> Speaking of which, relativising genitives isn't so straightforward. The above site translates <i>a friend whose father is a teacher</i> as <hacm>hacn le til kaan lex xaxan</hacm> (friend <sc>rel</sc> have father as teacher). What should you do if the clause uses some other verb? Beats me. </li>
    <li> You might be confused about <a href="http://conlinguistics.org/arka/e_study_malt_12.html">&quot;turning conjunctions into casers&quot;</a>. In short, a preposition (note: we're not including <hacm>e</hacm>, which is special) can modify only a verb by default. Attaching <hacm>-en</hacm> allows it to modify a noun instead. </li>
  </ul>
